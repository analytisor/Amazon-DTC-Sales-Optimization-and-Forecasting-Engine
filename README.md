# Amazon-DTC-Sales-Optimization-and-Forecasting-Engine

## **SUMMARY**

### **Challenge**

The company faced a critical challenge of aligning finance, operations, and marketing departments under a new change management directive to minimize losses. Given that 85% of sales were conducted on Amazon, it became imperative to understand the impact of paid advertising that was directed to the Shopify website and then attributed to sales on Amazon. The goal was to reduce ad spend while ensuring that enough inventory available in the warehouse could be sold, satisfying the new targets.

### **Solution**

To address this challenge, I developed the **Sales Forecast Modeling Engine** using Google Sheets, leveraging Amazon Attribution data to track the impact of paid advertising on sales. This tool introduced new metrics such as **Cost Per Visit** and **Share of Paid Visits**, enabling precise forecasting. The engine allowed for detailed input of advertising budgets and discount offers across different weeks, providing accurate projections of key metrics like Amazon conversion rate, total sales units, and customer acquisition costs.

### **Impact**

The implementation of this modeling engine enabled all departments to quickly align with the new targets. Finance was pleased as it allowed for accurate cash flow planning, marketing was able to adjust ad spend in line with the new sales targets, and operations successfully managed to sell through the remaining inventory without the need for additional orders. This comprehensive tool ensured that each department's objectives were met efficiently and effectively.

### **Metrics and Dimensions**

**Key Metrics:**
- Amazon Conversion Rate (CR %)
- **Cost Per Visit (CPV)**
- **Share of Paid Visits**
- Paid Visits vs. Organic Visits
- Unit Sales per Week
- Total Discount Amount
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- **Ad Spend**: Total advertising budget allocated per week

**Key Dimensions:**
- **SKU Discount Amount:** Discount applied per product for specific campaigns
- **Campaign Timing:** Week-by-week analysis of performance, adjusted for events like Black Friday and Prime Day
- **Traffic Source:** Breakdown between paid and organic traffic on Amazon

### **Summary of Insights**

By identifying a **Cost Per Visit** of $3.50 and a **Share of Paid Visits** of 40%, combined with the historical Amazon conversion rate, we were able to accurately assess the impact of reducing paid advertising on total sales units. This analysis helped in setting a target that satisfied finance's cash flow requirements while ensuring that all remaining inventory was sold by the end of the year. The forecasting also took into account sales spikes during key events like Fall Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday through Cyber Monday.

Another critical insight was the integration of metrics such as Amazon return rate, Shopify return rate, Shopify's share of sales, Amazon commission rate, and overall product Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). These factors allowed us to calculate the new expected total bottom line for the business under the revised targets, providing a clear picture of profitability.

### **Recommendation and Next Steps**

- Develop the engine's capability to process daily discount targets and output daily projections for traffic, ad spend, unit sales, and total costs, making the forecasting even more dynamic and responsive to real-time changes in the market.
- Utilize the weekly targets established by the model to continuously track actual vs. target performance on a weekly basis, ensuring the company remains on the correct path toward achieving its goals.
